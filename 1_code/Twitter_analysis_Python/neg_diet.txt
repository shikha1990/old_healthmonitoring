I'm scared of Monday. For the sheer fact I have to get back to the healthy eating bullshit! I love my cheat Sunday's!
Have been eating healthy just need less Soya Sauce, garlic bread, cheese, Pasta, Soda, and chocolate in my diet
ok after I finish this bag of mini Oreos I'll start eating healthy
Eating french fries for dinner #healthy #cleaneating 
I've been eating nothing but fast food. I need to get my gym membership with Diana and that will motivate me with eat healthy
My life consists of sitting in fast food parking lots alone eating my weight in mcflurries and cheeseburgers
i've been eating fast food a lot lately
"I will stop eating fast food tomorrow" is a lie I tell myself at least 3 times a day
Spending the rest of my night eating unhealthy food while watching the Kardashians
I've been eating so unhealthy these past couple of days
I feel like I need to go on a run or something for how unhealthy I've been eating for the past few days 
My talents include eating unhealthy amounts of food and avoiding my responsibilities
Walk into my house to see Buckeyes, pecan pie, cake and cookies. Let the weekend of unhealthy eating begin! 
so beyond pumped for the unhealthy amount of food I'm planning on eating tomorrow
my face is breaking out and that's what I get for eating this unhealthy food.
